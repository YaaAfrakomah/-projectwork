    <h3> CAUSES OF MALNUTRITION AMONG CHILDREN.</h3>

    <p>
        Lack of food: this is common among the low 
        income group as well as those who are homeless.<br>
        Those having difficulty eating due to painful teeth or other painful lesions of the mouth.<br>
        Those with dysphagia or difficulty swallowing are also at risk of malnutrition.<br>
        This could be due to a blockage in the throat or mouth or due to sores in the mouth.<br>
        Loss of appetite.<br> Common causes of loss of appetite include cancers, tumours,
        depressive illness and other mental illnesses, liver or kidney disease, chronic infections etc.<br>
         Those with a limited knowledge about nutrition tend to follow an unhealthy 
        diet with not enough nutrients,
         vitamins and minerals and are at risk of malnutrition.<br>
        Elderly living alone, disabled persons living alone or young students living on their
         own often have difficulty 
        cooking healthy balanced meals for themselves and may be at risk of malnutrition. <br>
        The elderly (over 65 years of age are), especially those living in care facilities are 
        at a higher risk of malnutrition.<br> 
        
    </p>
     <p>
        
        These individuals have long term illnesses that affect their appetite 
        and ability to absorb nutrients from food and they may also have difficulty feeding themselves.<br> In addition, 
        there may be concomitant mental ailments like depression that affect appetite and food intake.<br>
        Those who abuse drugs or are chronic alcoholics.<br>
        Those with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa have difficulty maintaining adequate nutrition.<br>
        Those with digestive illnesses like ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease or malabsorption syndrome 
        have difficulty in assimilating the nutrients from diet and may suffer from malnutrition.<br>
        Those with diarrhea or persistent nausea or vomiting.<br>
        Some medications tend to alter the body’s ability to absorb and break
         down nutrients and taking these may lead to malnutrition.<br>
        The demand for energy from food exceeds the amount of food taken.<br>
         This includes those who have suffered a serious injury, 
        burn or after major surgical procedures.<br> This also includes pregnant women and 
        children whose growth and needs 
        for the unborn baby causes increased demand for nutrients and calories that may be deficient in a normal diet.<br>
        Among children lack of knowledge of adequate feeding among parents is the leading cause of malnutrition worldwide.<br>
        Premature babies are at a higher risk of malnutrition as are infants at the time of weaning.<br>

        Malnutrition occurs when the body does not receive a sufficient amount
         of nutrients in order to remain a healthy state. Malnutrition is especially 
         prevalent in developing countries. These countries lack the resources and money
          in order to have a consistent source of food. Sometimes when they get food, it is not 
          in the best condition or it is not clean. In 2002 there were 852 million reported cases
           of malnutrition, with 815 million of those coming from developing nations (Krawinkel, 2005). 
           This means that the people who were said to have malnutrition were at least two deviations 
           under the standard weight of a normal person at that certain age. 
           However, progress is being made in the number of cases of malnutrition.
            The number of cases in children…show more content…
         
                This is why many poor people in developing nations develop malnutrition.
                 Finally the fifth solution is research and development to increase crop yields.
                  If more research is done to produce more crops then there will be more food for many nations.
                   Since food would not be as sarce, the prices of the food would plummet. 
                   This would allow for more food to be bought since it is more affordable.
                    If more is invested in to agriculture, then the number of hungry people in the world would be significantly lower.
                     All of these solutions are very plausible and would not cost that much money. 
                     The disadvantages of the topic of malnutrition is that there is not a lot of 
                     attention toward the effects of malnutrition. The hardships that are caused by

        Children suffering malnutrition can develop ailments, disorders and diseases that may affect them for the rest of their lives.
Short-Term Implications
•	Immune System: When children suffer from malnutrition, they also suffer from a weakened immune system. Because of this, they have an increased risk of developing infections or contracting contagious diseases. If their living conditions are unsanitary, they are more apt to get infections from others in the home. These children tend to have a deficiency in vitamin A, zinc and iron.
•	Poor Growth: When children do not receive a sufficient amount of nutrients while they are growing, they may suffer from growth retardation. Because they are malnourished, they have a greater chance of getting gastrointestinal infections. This can make their condition even worse because while they are not getting enough nutrients, they also cannot properly absorb the ones that they do get.
Long-Term Implications
•	Poor Growth: Long term growth complications can arise because of deficiencies in vitamins A and D, magnesium, zinc, magnesium and iron. This can lead to disorders like anorexia or a protein deficiency resulting in poor bone development. If they remain in their current living conditions and do not receive proper nutrients, they will never be able to recover to their full growth potential. Often these children suffer from stunted height.
•	Brain Development: If a child is malnourished, the brain is negatively affected and can suffer from insufficient development. This can result in ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), learning disabilities, low IQ scores, poor language development, memory and focus problems, low problem-solving and weakened school performance.
Treating Malnourished Children
If caught early enough, several of the effects of malnutrition can be reversed. This is especially so if the situation was only short term.
A child suspected of being malnourished should be evaluated by a doctor. The doctor will be able to conduct a physical exam and check for underlying conditions that lead to malnutrition. He will ask questions about the child's diet and eating habits. In addition, the doctor may also order blood tests, measure the child's body mass index, check height and weight and order other tests as deemed necessary.
If an underlying condition is causing the child's condition, the doctor will recommend ways to help combat the malnutrition, which may include a referral to a specialist. If the problem lies with the amount and type of food the child eats, a dietitian will come up with a food plan and may recommend vitamin and mineral supplements.
